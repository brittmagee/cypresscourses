Hi Tia, Jada, Abram and Jonathan! Please reference the information below to get everything up and running. I wanted to use a website template to create my tests and CI. Hope you enjoy! -Brittani

## Cypress.io practice testing site with React.js
### Website template can be downloaded at [Envato Elements | eTreeks - Online Course & Education React JS](https://elements.envato.com/etreeks-online-courses-education-react-js-them-FU7RYMT)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/demo-1](http://localhost:3000/demo-1) with your browser to see the result.
